# # Go for a walk

# Exercise 2: Dogs

# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

# class Dog:
#     def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

# print(dog1.fight(dog2))
# print(dog2.fight(dog3))
# print(dog1.fight(dog3))

# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# “dog_name does a barrel roll”.
# “dog_name stands on his back legs”.
# “dog_name shakes your hand”.
# “dog_name plays dead”.

# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:

# members: list of dictionaries
# last_name : (string)

# Implement the following methods:

# born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don’t forget to print a message congratulating the family.
# is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
# family_presentation: a method that prints the family’s last name and all the members’ details.

# Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.
